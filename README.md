# SonicBench :rocket:	
Benchmark of data processing speed for major programming languages. This repositary contains many benchmark testing for popular programming languages like python, Java and C++. The main task is to test the data anlysis skills of these programming languages using their linear algebra library, data analysis library and machine learning frameworks.<br/>

## Structure :file_folder:
This repositary contains multiple testing tasks and therefore its whole structure is task specified. In each task folder you will find the testing scripts using different languages:<br/>
* `arrayCompute` Testing array manipulation speed

## Overview :golf:
The testing results for different task is shown below:<br/>
### `arrayCompute`
* netCDF4 data loading
* array manipulation and computing
Timing: :clock1030:
